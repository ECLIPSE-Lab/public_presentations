 
# Sensor Fusion as a Regression Problem

- High-resolution chemical imaging in STEM is limited by inelastic scattering.
- HAADF gives high SNR but lacks chemical specificity.
- EDX/EELS gives chemistry but is noisy at low dose.
- Goal: Fuse both signals for high-quality chemical maps.

## Data Fusion as Inverse Problem

**Reconstruction goal:**
$$
\hat{x} = \arg\min_{x \geq 0} \; \Psi_1(x) + \lambda_1 \Psi_2(x) + \lambda_2 \text{TV}(x)
$$

Where:

- $\Psi_1$: HAADF model loss
- $\Psi_2$: spectroscopic data fidelity
- $\text{TV}(x)$: regularization term

---

## First Term: HAADF Consistency

**HAADF image model:**
$$
\Psi_1(x) = \frac{1}{2} \| b_H - A x^\gamma \|_2^2
$$

- $b_H$: measured HAADF signal
- $x^\gamma$: element-wise power (Z-contrast)
- $\gamma \approx 1.7$: approximates Z-contrast

**Interpretation:**
Ensure the fused chemical map explains HAADF contrast.

## Second Term: Spectroscopic Fidelity

**Poisson noise model for EDX/EELS:**
$$
\Psi_2(x) = \sum_i 1^T x_i - b_i^T \log(x_i + \varepsilon)
$$

- $x_i$: reconstructed map of element $i$
- $b_i$: measured EDX/EELS signal for element $i$
- $\varepsilon$: small constant to avoid $\log(0)$

**Interpretation:**
Match fused maps with noisy spectroscopic measurements.

---

## Third Term: Total Variation (TV)

**Channel-wise total variation:**
$$
\text{TV}(x) = \sum_i \|x_i\|_{TV}
$$

**Purpose:**
- Promote piecewise smooth maps
- Reduce noise
- Preserve edges

**Popular in:**
- Compressed sensing
- Image denoising

## Summary of Loss Terms

| Term | Meaning | Benefit |
|------|---------|---------|
| $\Psi_1$ | HAADF consistency | Uses high SNR elastic signal |
| $\Psi_2$ | Spectroscopy fidelity | Honors noisy chemical data |
| $\text{TV}(x)$ | Regularization | Noise suppression and smoothness |

All terms are necessary for accurate low-dose chemical recovery.

# Practical Results

- Improves SNR by 300–500%.
- Reduces required dose by >10×.
- Recovers stoichiometry with <15% error.

# Takeaways

- Multi-modal fusion = better signal, lower dose.
- Expressed as interpretable optimization.
- Each term plays a distinct role.

**Future outlook:** Combine with additional modalities (e.g., ABF, ptychography).
