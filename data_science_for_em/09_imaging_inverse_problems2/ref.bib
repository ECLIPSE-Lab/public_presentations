In structural biology, three-dimensional structures of proteins are routinely determined from thousands of identical particles using phase-contrast TEM. In materials science, three-dimensional atomic structures of complex nanomaterials have been determined using atomic electron tomography (AET). However, neither of these methods can determine the three-dimensional atomic structure of heterogeneous nanomaterials containing light elements. Here, we perform ptychographic electron tomography from 34.5 million diffraction patterns to reconstruct an atomic resolution tilt series of a double wall-carbon nanotube (DW-CNT) encapsulating a complex ZrTe sandwich structure. Class averaging the resulting tilt series images and subpixel localization of the atomic peaks reveals a Zr11Te50 structure containing a previously unobserved ZrTe2 phase in the core. The experimental realization of atomic resolution ptychographic electron tomography will allow for the structural determination of a wide range of beam-sensitive nanomaterials containing light elements.}, number={11}, journal={Nature Communications}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Pelz, Philipp M. and Griffin, Sinéad M. and Stonemeyer, Scott and Popple, Derek and DeVyldere, Hannah and Ercius, Peter and Zettl, Alex and Scott, Mary C. and Ophus, Colin}, year={2023}, month=nov, pages={7906}, language={en} }

Modern algorithms coupled with fast and efficient detectors allow imaging specimens with tens of nanometers thicknesses with sub-0.5 Ångstrom lateral resolution. However, the axial resolution in these approaches is currently limited to a few nanometers, limiting their ability to solve novel atomic structures ab initio. Here, we experimentally demonstrate multi-slice ptychographic electron tomography, which allows atomic resolution three-dimensional phase-contrast imaging in a volume surpassing the depth of field limits. We reconstruct tilt-series 4D-STEM measurements of a nanocube, yielding 2 Å axial and 0.7 Å transverse resolution in a reconstructed volume of . Our results demonstrate a 13.5-fold improvement in axial resolution compared to multi-slice ptychography while retaining the atomic lateral resolution and the capability to image volumes beyond the depth of field limit. Multi-slice ptychographic electron tomography significantly expands the volume of materials accessible using high-resolution electron microscopy. We discuss further experimental and algorithmic improvements necessary to also resolve single weakly scattering atoms in 3D.}, number={1}, journal={Journal of Physics: Materials}, publisher={IOP Publishing}, author={Romanov, Andrey and Cho, Min Gee and Scott, Mary Cooper and Pelz, Philipp}, year={2024}, month=dec, pages={015005}, language={en} }

Linear electron tomography methods are limited by the missing wedge effect, requiring a high tilt range. Multislice ptychography can achieve deep sub-Ångstrom resolution in the transverse direction, but depth resolution is limited to 2 to 3 nanometers. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an end-to-end approach to reconstructing the electrostatic potential volume of the sample directly from the 4D-STEM datasets. End-to-end multislice ptychographic tomography recovers several slices at each tomography tilt angle and compensates for the missing wedge effect. The algorithm is initially tested in simulation with a Pt@Al2O3 core–shell nanoparticle, where both heavy and light atoms are recovered in 3D from an unaligned 4D-STEM tilt series with a restricted tilt range of 90 degrees. We also demonstrate the algorithm experimentally, recovering a Te nanoparticle with sub-Ångstrom resolution.}, number={1}, journal={Physica Scripta}, publisher={IOP Publishing}, author={You, Shengbo and Romanov, Andrey and Pelz, Philipp M}, year={2024}, month=dec, pages={015404}, language={en} }
 @article{Seifer_2024, title={Optimizing Contrast in Automated 4D STEM Cryotomography}, volume={30}, ISSN={1431-9276}, DOI={10.1093/mam/ozae050}, abstractNote={4D STEM is an emerging approach to electron microscopy. While it was developed principally for high-resolution studies in materials science, the possibility to collect the entire transmitted flux makes it attractive for cryomicroscopy in application to life science and radiation-sensitive materials where dose efficiency is of utmost importance. We present a workflow to acquire tomographic tilt series of 4D STEM data sets using a segmented diode and an ultrafast pixelated detector, demonstrating the methods using a specimen of a T4 bacteriophage. Full integration with the SerialEM platform conveniently provides all the tools for grid navigation and automation of the data collection. Scripts are provided to convert the raw data to mrc format files and further to generate a variety of modes representing both scattering and phase contrasts, including incoherent and annular bright field, integrated center of mass, and parallax decomposition of a simulated integrated differential phase contrast. Principal component analysis of virtual annular detectors proves particularly useful, and axial contrast is improved by 3D deconvolution with an optimized point spread function. Contrast optimization enables visualization of irregular features such as DNA strands and thin filaments of the phage tails, which would be lost upon averaging or imposition of an inappropriate symmetry.}, number={3}, journal={Microscopy and Microanalysis}, author={Seifer, Shahar and Kirchweger, Peter and Edel, Karlina Maria and Elbaum, Michael}, year={2024}, month=jun, pages={476–488} }

However, the possibilities for recording tomographic tilt series in a high-throughput manner are limited, in part by the lamella-shaped samples. Here we utilize a geometrical sample model and optical image shift to record tens of tilt series in parallel, thereby saving time and gaining access to sample areas conventionally used for tracking specimen movement. The parallel cryo electron tomography (PACE-tomo) method achieves a throughput faster than 5 min per tilt series and allows for the collection of sample areas that were previously unreachable, thus maximizing the amount of data from each lamella. Performance testing with ribosomes in vitro and in situ on state-of-the-art and general-purpose microscopes demonstrated the high throughput and quality of PACE-tomo.}, number={11}, journal={Nature Methods}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Eisenstein, Fabian and Yanagisawa, Haruaki and Kashihara, Hiroka and Kikkawa, Masahide and Tsukita, Sachiko and Danev, Radostin}, year={2023}, month=jan, pages={131–138}, language={en} }

  volume={142}, ISSN={0002-7863}, DOI={10.1021/jacs.0c05175}, 
  abstractNote={Helical structures are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic materials across multiple length scales. Excellent and sometimes unusual chiral optical, mechanical, and sensing properties have been previously demonstrated in such symmetry-breaking shape, yet a general principle to realize helical structures at the sub-100 nm scale via colloidal synthesis remains underexplored. In this work, we describe the wet-chemical synthesis of monodisperse nanohelices based on gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3). Aberration-corrected electron microscopy revealed that individual nanohelices consist of a bilayer structure with the outer and inner layers derived from the {111} and {100} planes of bulk Gd2O3, respectively. Distinct from existing inorganic nanocoils with flexible bending geometries, the built-in lattice misfit between two adjacent crystal planes induces continuous helical growth yielding three-dimensional rigid nanohelices. Furthermore, the presence of water in the reaction was found to suppress the formation of nanohelices, producing nanoplates expressing predominantly {111} planes. Our study not only provides a bottom-up synthetic route and mechanistic understanding of nanohelices formation but may also open up new possibilities for creating chiral plasmonic nanostructures, luminescent biological labels, and nanoscale transducers.}, number={29}, journal={Journal of the American Chemical Society}, publisher={American Chemical Society}, author={Liu, Yang and Li, Yuda and Jeong, Soojin and Wang, Yi and Chen, Jun and Ye, Xingchen}, year={2020}, month=jul, pages={12777–12783} }
