Deep kernel learning enables active learning of the relationship between local structure and 4D-STEM-based descriptors. With this, efficient and “intelligent” probing of dissimilar structural elements to discover desired physical functionality is made possible. This approach allows effective navigation of the sample in an automated fashion guided by either a predetermined physical phenomenon, such as strongest electric field magnitude, or in an exploratory fashion. We verify the approach first on preacquired 4D-STEM data and further implement it experimentally on an operational STEM. The experimental discovery workflow is demonstrated using graphene and subsequently extended toward a lesser-known layered 2D van der Waals material, MnPS3. This approach establishes a pathway for physics-driven automated 4D-STEM experiments that enable probing the physics of strongly correlated systems and quantum materials and devices, as well as exploration of beam-sensitive materials.}, journal={ACS Nano}, publisher={American Chemical Society}, author={Roccapriore, Kevin M. and Dyck, Ondrej and Oxley, Mark P. and Ziatdinov, Maxim and Kalinin, Sergei V.}, year={2022}, month=apr }

Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH}, ISSN={2198-3844}, DOI={10.1002/advs.202203422}, abstractNote={Physics-driven discovery in an autonomous experiment has emerged as a dream application of machine learning in physical sciences. Here, this work develops and experimentally implements a deep kernel learning (DKL) workflow combining the correlative prediction of the target functional response and its uncertainty from the structure, and physics-based selection of acquisition function, which autonomously guides the navigation of the image space. Compared to classical Bayesian optimization (BO) methods, this approach allows to capture the complex spatial features present in the images of realistic materials, and dynamically learn structure–property relationships. In combination with the flexible scalarizer function that allows to ascribe the degree of physical interest to predicted spectra, this enables physical discovery in automated experiment. Here, this approach is illustrated for nanoplasmonic studies of nanoparticles and experimentally implemented in a truly autonomous fashion for bulk- and edge plasmon discovery in MnPS3, a lesser-known beam-sensitive layered 2D material. This approach is universal, can be directly used as-is with any specimen, and is expected to be applicable to any probe-based microscopic techniques including other STEM modalities, scanning probe microscopies, chemical, and optical imaging.}, number={36}, journal={Advanced Science}, author={Roccapriore, Kevin M. and Kalinin, Sergei V. and Ziatdinov, Maxim}, year={2022}, pages={2203422}, language={en} }
