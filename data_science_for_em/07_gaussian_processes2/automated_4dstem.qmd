## Why automate 4D‑STEM?

- High‑dimensional data cube → costly in **dose** & **time**  
- Human ROI selection = biased & inefficient  
- **Active learning** can steer the probe to where information content is highest


## From Bayesian Optimisation to Autonomous STEM

We have already covered

1. **Bayesian optimisation (BO)**  
2. **Deep‑Kernel Learning (DKL)**

Today we see **both** in action inside the microscope.

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{EI}(\mathbf{x}) = \big(\mu(\mathbf{x}) - y^{+} - \xi\big)\,\Phi\!\left(\dfrac{\mu(\mathbf{x})-y^{+}-\xi}{\sigma(\mathbf{x})}\right) + \sigma(\mathbf{x})\,\phi\!\left(\dfrac{\mu(\mathbf{x})-y^{+}-\xi}{\sigma(\mathbf{x})}\right)
\end{equation}

Two 4D datasets demonstrate the approach:

- **Single-layer and bilayer graphene** with defects and dopant atoms
- **Diffraction patterns** recorded at all pixel positions
- **Center of mass (CoM)** calculation from central beam
- **Relative CoM shifts** → local electric field computation
- **Derived quantities**: charge density and electric potential

## Damage Mitigation Strategy

**Intelligent sampling** reduces beam damage through:

- **Specimen protection**: Between training steps, specimen is blocked from electron irradiation
- **Minimal sampling**: Only a small fraction of available points are ever visited
- **HAADF-STEM pre-scan**: Complete image space access for the model
- **Controlled dose**: Small but unavoidable initial dose compared to full 4D acquisition

**Nanobeam electron diffraction (NBED)** approach:

- **Smaller convergence angle** → diffraction discs
- **Bragg disc centers** scalarizer function  
- **First-order diffraction** only considered
- **Boundary preference** in acquisition function
- **Vacuum measurements** for uncertainty reduction
