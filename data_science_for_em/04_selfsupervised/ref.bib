Because the distribution of interstitial atoms in matrix materials is usually disordered and most of them are light atoms with weak scattering ability, it remains a challenge to directly image single interstitial atoms and measure their geometrical positions. In this work, direct imaging and measuring of single interstitial atoms have been realized with adaptive-propagator ptychography. The measurement of their three-dimensional coordinates enables quantitative analysis of the pair distribution function of the interstitial atoms and reveals the anisotropic occupation of oxygen in the interstitial sites in titanium. The current work paves the way for the determination of interstitial atoms in materials, and for the correlation between the atomic-scale behavior of interstitial atoms and the physical properties of materials.}, note={arXiv:2405.18164 [cond-mat]}, number={arXiv:2405.18164}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Cui, Jizhe and Sha, Haozhi and Mao, Liangze and Sun, Kang and Yang, Wenfeng and Yu, Rong}, year={2024}, month=may }

However, this process invariably introduces optical path differences in the electron beam across different sample positions, significantly compromising image quality, particularly over large fields of view. To address this challenge, we developed path difference ptychography (PDP), a method capable of decoupling path differences from the four-dimensional data during reconstruction. This enables the acquisition of high-quality, large-scale images, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of materials microstructure. Moreover, PDP has the potential to promote the widespread application of ptychographic tomography in the analysis of planar samples.}, note={arXiv:2408.11332 [cond-mat, physics:physics]}, number={arXiv:2408.11332}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Cui, Jizhe and Zheng, Yi and Sun, Kang and Yang, Wenfeng and Sha, Haozhi and Yu, Rong}, year={2024}, month=aug }

Several key questions regarding the pairing mechanism remain to be answered, such as the most relevant atomic orbitals and the role of atomic deficiencies. Here we develop a new, energy-filtered, multislice electron ptychography technique, assisted by electron energy-loss spectroscopy, to address these critical issues. Oxygen vacancies are directly visualized and are found to primarily occupy the inner apical sites, which have been proposed to be crucial to superconductivity13,14. We precisely determine the nanoscale stoichiometry and its correlation to the oxygen K-edge spectra, which reveals a significant inhomogeneity in the oxygen content and electronic structure within the sample. The spectroscopic results also reveal that stoichiometric La3Ni2O7 has strong charge-transfer characteristics, with holes that are self-doped from Ni sites into O sites. The ligand holes mainly reside on the inner apical O and the planar O, whereas the density on the outer apical O is negligible. As the concentration of O vacancies increases, ligand holes on both sites are simultaneously annihilated. These observations will assist in further development and understanding of superconducting nickelate materials. Our imaging technique for quantifying atomic deficiencies can also be widely applied in materials science and condensed-matter physics.}, journal={Nature}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Dong, Zehao and Huo, Mengwu and Li, Jie and Li, Jingyuan and Li, Pengcheng and Sun, Hualei and Gu, Lin and Lu, Yi and Wang, Meng and Wang, Yayu and Chen, Zhen}, year={2024}, month=jun, pages={1–6}, language={en} }

Using multislice electron ptychography, we successfully measured the atomic structure of zeolite at sub-angstrom lateral resolution for 100-nanometer-thick samples. Both lateral and depth deformations of the straight channels are mapped, showing the three-dimensional structural inhomogeneity and flexibility. Since most zeolites in industrial applications are usually tens to hundreds of nanometers thick, the sub-angstrom resolution imaging and accurate measurements of depth-dependent local structures with electron ptychography at low-dose condition will find wide applications in porous materials close to their industrially relevant conditions.}, number={11}, journal={Science Advances}, publisher={American Association for the Advancement of Science}, author={Sha, Haozhi and Cui, Jizhe and Li, Jialu and Zhang, Yuxuan and Yang, Wenfeng and Li, Yadong and Yu, Rong}, year={2023}, month=mar, pages={eadf1151} }

Further improving the information limit in microscopic imaging requires further improvements in methodology. Here we report a ptychographic method that describes the object as the sum of discrete atomic-orbital-like functions (for example, Gaussian functions) and the probe in terms of aberration functions. Using this method, we realize an improved information limit of microscopic imaging, reaching down to 14 pm. High-quality probes and objects contribute to superior signal-to-noise ratios at low electron doses, allowing for relaxation of the sample thickness restriction to 50 nm for dense materials. Additionally, our method has the capability to decompose the total phase into element components, revealing that the information limit is element dependent. With enhanced spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and thickness threshold compared with conventional ptychography methods, our local-orbital ptychography may find applications in atomic-resolution imaging of metals, ceramics, electronic devices or beam-sensitive material.}, journal={Nature Nanotechnology}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Yang, Wenfeng and Sha, Haozhi and Cui, Jizhe and Mao, Liangze and Yu, Rong}, year={2024}, month=jan, pages={1–6}, language={en} }

Although deep-sub-angstrom resolution has been achieved with multislice electron ptychography, the sample thickness is typically very limited. By combining energy filtering and extended local-orbital ptychography (eLOP) that retrieves varying aberrations during electron scanning, here we report ptychographic reconstructions for silicon as thick as 85 nm, approximately three times larger than usual thickness threshold for conventional multislice electron ptychography. The elimination of aberration variations contributes to accurate reconstructions with an information limit of 18 pm and atomic position precision of 0.39 pm. Accurate ptychographic reconstructions for thick objects can facilitate the discovery or interpretation of intrinsic structural and physical phenomena in solids, which is of great significance in physics, chemistry, materials science, and semiconductor device engineering.}, note={arXiv:2502.18294 [cond-mat]}, number={arXiv:2502.18294}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Yang, Wenfeng and Sha, Haozhi and Cui, Jizhe and Yu, Rong}, year={2025}, month=feb }

Journal of Microscopy published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Microscopical Society.}, ISSN={1365-2818}, DOI={10.1111/jmi.13321}, abstractNote={The concept of electronic orbitals has enabled the understanding of a wide range of physical and chemical properties of solids through the definition of, for example, chemical bonding between atoms. In the transmission electron microscope, which is one of the most used and powerful analytical tools for high-spatial-resolution analysis of solids, the accessible quantity is the local distribution of electronic states. However, the interpretation of electronic state maps at atomic resolution in terms of electronic orbitals is far from obvious, not always possible, and often remains a major hurdle preventing a better understanding of the properties of the system of interest. In this review, the current state of the art of the experimental aspects for electronic state mapping and its interpretation as electronic orbitals is presented, considering approaches that rely on elastic and inelastic scattering, in real and reciprocal spaces. This work goes beyond resolving spectral variations between adjacent atomic columns, as it aims at providing deeper information about, for example, the spatial or momentum distributions of the states involved. The advantages and disadvantages of existing experimental approaches are discussed, while the challenges to overcome and future perspectives are explored in an effort to establish the current state of knowledge in this field. The aims of this review are also to foster the interest of the scientific community and to trigger a global effort to further enhance the current analytical capabilities of transmission electron microscopy for chemical bonding and electronic structure analysis.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of Microscopy}, author={Bugnet, M. and Löffler, S. and Ederer, M. and Kepaptsoglou, D.
