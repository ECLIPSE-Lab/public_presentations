## Paradigm Shift

Computational imaging is going through a paradigm shift driven by machine learning

---

## Past: Hardware-Focused Approach

**Focus on hardware for image formation**

- Linear forward model: $y = Hs + n$
- $H$: imaging operator/system (Integral operator)
- $s$: input signal
- $y$: output measurements
- $n$: noise

**Problem:** Recover $s$ from noisy measurements $y$

---

## The Easy Scenario

**Inverse problem is well-posed** if $\exists c_0 > 0$ s.t., for all $s \in X$, $c_0 \|s\| \leq \|Hs\|$

(assuming noise is negligible)

**Solution:** $s \approx H^{-1}y$

**Backprojection (poor man's solution):** $s \approx H^T y$

---

## Present: Digital Signal Processing

**Use digital signal processing for improved performance**

- Still linear forward model: $y = Hs + n$
- Enhanced computational methods
- Better reconstruction algorithms

---

## Key Concepts

### Forward Model
- $y = Hs + n$ where $H$ is the imaging operator
- $s$ is the unknown signal/image
- $y$ are the measurements
- $n$ represents noise

### Inverse Problem
- Goal: Recover $s$ from $y$
- Challenge: Ill-posed nature when $H$ is not invertible or poorly conditioned

### Well-Posedness
- Exists $c_0 > 0$ such that $c_0 \|s\| \leq \|Hs\|$ for all $s$
- Ensures stable reconstruction

## Machine Learning Integration

The field is evolving to incorporate machine learning methods:

1. **Data-driven priors**
2. **Learned reconstruction networks**
3. **End-to-end optimization**
4. **Hybrid model-based and learning approaches**

---

## Applications in Bio-Imaging

- **Medical imaging** (MRI, CT, ultrasound)
- **Microscopy** (fluorescence, phase contrast)
- **Tomography** (3D reconstruction)
- **Super-resolution imaging**

---

## Challenges

1. **Ill-posedness** - Multiple solutions possible
2. **Noise amplification** - Small noise → large errors
3. **Computational complexity** - Large-scale problems
4. **Model uncertainty** - Imperfect forward models

---

## Future Directions

- **Deep learning integration**
- **Uncertainty quantification**
- **Real-time processing**
- **Multi-modal imaging**
- **Interpretable AI**
