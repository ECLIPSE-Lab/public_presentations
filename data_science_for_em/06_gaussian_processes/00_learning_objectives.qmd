## Why Gaussian Processes? Key Advantages for Electron Microscopy
 
* **Uncertainty Quantification:** GPs provide principled uncertainty estimates, crucial for scientific applications

* **Small Data Performance:** Excel with limited training data common in EM experiments

* **Interpretability:** Kernel parameters have clear physical meaning

* **Flexibility:** Can incorporate domain knowledge through kernel design

* **Bayesian Framework:** Natural handling of experimental uncertainties
