## Welcome

### Week 1 – What Makes Materials Data Special?

**Course goals for today:**

- Understand the diversity and physics of materials data modalities  
- See PSPP as a **data graph** that structures ML tasks  
- Learn why **vision-based ML** and **time-series ML** are central to materials problems

---

## Outline

1. The landscape of materials data  
2. PSPP as a *data graph*  
3. Why vision-based ML dominates characterization  
4. Why time-series ML dominates processing  
5. Summary & discussion

## 1. The Landscape of Materials Data

### Materials science = multi-modal data universe

Different instruments → different physics → different data structures → different ML challenges.

We will walk through:

- Micrographs (optical, SEM, TEM)
- EBSD (orientation images)
- EDS/EELS (spectral hypercubes)
- XRD (1D patterns)
- Process logs & thermal histories
- Mechanical testing curves (stress–strain)

---

## Micrographs

**Examples:** Optical, SEM, BF/DF TEM.

**Physics encoded:**

- Contrast from topography, Z-contrast, thickness, diffraction  
- Resolution & pixel size define information content  
- Artifacts: drift, charging, contamination, noise  

**ML implications:**

- Strong spatial correlations → CNNs work well  
- Severe domain shift (SEM ≠ optical ≠ TEM)

---

## EBSD Maps

**Orientation fields** expressed as:

- Euler angles  
- Quaternions  
- Orientation distribution functions (ODF)

**What makes them special?**

- Strong pixel-to-pixel correlation  
- Grain boundaries appear as misorientation gradients  
- Indexing noise produces false boundaries  

**ML implications:**

- Rotation-aware models are ideal  
- Ground truth labels can be ambiguous

---

## Spectral Data: EDS & EELS

**Characteristics:**

- High-dimensional spectra  
- Peaks + backgrounds + noise  
- Often low SNR (beam damage constraints)

**ML challenges:**

- Dimensionality reduction obligatory  
- PCA / NMF / ICA essential  
- Often unsupervised tasks (no ground truth)

---

## XRD Patterns

**Encodes:**

- Lattice spacing → peak positions  
- Strain & crystallinity → peak shape  
- Texture → peak intensities

**ML tasks:**

- Phase identification  
- Lattice parameter extraction  
- Pattern similarity search

---

## Process Logs & Time-Series

**Sources:**

- Heat-treatment cycles  
- Additive manufacturing melt pools  
- SPS sintering curves  
- Mechanical load histories

**Properties:**

- Irregular sampling  
- Sensor drift  
- Strong time correlation

**ML tasks:**

- Forecasting  
- Classification  
- Regression (process → property)

---

## Stress–Strain Curves

A stress–strain curve is **functional data**:

Encodes:

- Yield behavior  
- Work hardening  
- Strain-rate dependence  
- Damage accumulation  

ML considerations:

- Needs feature extraction  
- Or a sequence model  
- Requires uncertainty quantification

---

## Summary: Why Materials Data Are Hard

- They come from **physics-based instruments**, not synthetic datasets  
- Noise, artifacts, and structure are inseparable  
- Data sizes are small  
- Modalities are heterogeneous  
- ML must incorporate physical reasoning

---

## 2. PSPP as a Data Graph

Processing → Structure → Property → Performance  
is not a simple chain — it's a **graph of data domains**.

---

## PSPP Nodes

- **Processing:** Heat treatment, AM parameters, rolling schedules  
- **Structure:** Micrographs, EBSD, phase fields, defects  
- **Property:** Hardness, modulus, diffusion, conductivity  
- **Performance:** Fatigue life, corrosion rate, creep resistance  

Each node contains distinct **data types**.

---

## PSPP Edges = ML Tasks

- **Processing → Structure**  
  Forecasting microstructure evolution  
  → Regression, physics-informed ML  

- **Structure → Property**  
  Predicting properties from structure  
  → Vision ML, graph ML  

- **Property → Performance**  
  Lifetime prediction  
  → Surrogate modeling, UQ  

- **Performance → Processing** (inverse design)  
  → Optimization under constraints

---

``` 

---

## Why PSPP Matters

- ML problems are inherently **multi-modal**  
- Information flows between domains  
- Missing edges → missing mechanisms  
- Noise propagates through the graph  
- Later in the course we will learn fusion methods

---

## 3. Why Vision-Based ML Is Central

### Microstructure determines material behavior.

ML must understand images because **structure mediates properties**.

---

## Microstructure = Latent Manifold

Encodes:

- Grain size & morphology  
- Phase distribution  
- Texture  
- Precipitates  
- Defects  

Physics hides in **topology**, not single numbers.

---

## CNNs & Material Structures

CNNs learn filters that correspond to:

- Edges → grain boundaries  
- Blobs → precipitates  
- Textures → orientation regions  
- Higher features → morphology classes  

Limitations:

- Transfer learning from ImageNet often weak  
- Materials images have different statistics

---

## Data Scarcity & Self-Supervision

Solutions:

- Contrastive pretraining  
- Domain-specific augmentations  
- Multi-view embedding methods  

We will cover these in detail later.

---

## Failure Modes in Microstructure ML

- Annotation ambiguity  
- Sample preparation bias  
- Instrument domain shift  
- No objective “ground truth” segmentation  

Understanding limitations is as important as training models.

---

## 4. Why Time-Series ML Matters for Processing

### Processing = time-evolving physics.

Structure forms **over time**, not instantaneously.

---

## Processing as a Dynamical System

Examples:

- Heat-treatment transformations  
- Melt pool instabilities  
- Dynamic recrystallization  
- Phase precipitation/solution  

Time carries the causal information.

---

## Processing Data Challenges

- Irregular sampling  
- Sensor corruption  
- Autocorrelation  
- Latent variables not measured  

Machine learning must handle **temporal context**.

---

## Time-Series ML Tasks

1. **Forecasting**  
   Predict microstructure or property evolution

2. **Classification**  
   Detect regime changes (AM instabilities)

3. **Regression**  
   Process → property mapping

---

## Hybrid Physics–ML

Approaches:

- Embed kinetic models (JMAK)  
- Diffusion-informed loss functions  
- Gaussian Process models for process maps  
- Sequence models with uncertainty  

This course will explore these hybrid approaches.

---

## 5. Summary

### Key Messages:

- Materials data are **structured, multi-modal, noisy, and physics-generated**.  
- PSPP defines a **web of ML tasks** connecting processing, structure, and properties.  
- Vision ML is crucial because structure is image-based.  
- Time-series ML is crucial because processing is dynamic.
