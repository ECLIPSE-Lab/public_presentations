## Welcome

### Week 8 — Process → Structure Regression & Uncertainty

**Goals for today:**

- Understand why predicting structure from processing is difficult  
- Learn regression strategies for process-driven microstructure prediction  
- Introduce Gaussian Processes (GPs)  
- Explore uncertainty as a tool for process design  
- Connect concepts with Materials Genomics surrogate modeling  

---

## Outline

1. Why process → structure prediction is challenging  
2. Regression models for process-driven outcomes  
3. Gaussian Processes  
4. Uncertainty as an engineering tool  
5. Practical GP pipelines  
6. Summary  

---

## 1. Why Process → Structure Prediction Is Hard

Materials structure depends on:

- Diffusion, nucleation, coarsening  
- Time–temperature cycles  
- Operator variability  
- Machine drift  
- Powder/batch variability  

Same process parameters ≠ identical structure.

The mapping is **not deterministic**.

We need **probabilistic regression**, not just point prediction.

---

## Structure as a Distribution

Examples:

- Grain size varies even with identical heat treatment  
- Porosity in AM varies layer-to-layer  
- SPS densification depends on powder lot  
- Cooling rate heterogeneity leads to microstructure spread  

**Goal:** predict a *distribution* of outcomes  
—not a single number.

---

## 2. Regression Models for Process → Structure

Classical models:

- Linear regression  
- k-NN regression  
- Random forest regressors  

Good for:

- Heat-treatment → hardness  
- SPS cycle → final density  
- Rolling forces → grain refinement index  

Limitations:

- Poor uncertainty estimates  
- Difficulty extrapolating  
- No probabilistic interpretation  

Leads to: **Gaussian Processes**.

---

## 3. Gaussian Processes (GPs)

### What is a GP?

A GP:

- Places a probability distribution over *functions*  
- Predicts a mean curve and an uncertainty band  
- Learns smooth, physics-like relationships  
- Naturally handles small, noisy datasets  

GP output:

- Mean prediction  
- Variance (epistemic + aleatoric)  
- Optional covariance structure

---

## Why GPs Are Perfect for Materials Processing

GPs handle:

- Few data points  
- Noisy measurements  
- Smooth thermomechanical relationships  
- Complex interactions between variables  
- Multi-sensor inputs (temp, time, pressure, laser power...)  

GP uncertainty captures:

- Lack of data  
- Process noise  
- Operator variability  
- Sensor drift  

---

## Kernels = Physics Priors

Intuitive kernel choices:

- **RBF kernel:** smooth diffusion-like processes  
- **Periodic kernel:** furnace cycles, AM hatch patterns  
- **Rational quadratic:** multi-scale variations  
- **Additive kernels:** combine thermal + mechanical + temporal signals  

Kernels embed physical assumptions.

---

## GP Example (Conceptual)

Predict grain size from:

- Soak temperature  
- Hold time  
- Cooling rate  

Output:

- Mean grain size  
- Uncertainty band (±1σ / ±2σ)

## GP Uncertainty: Interpretation

Uncertainty increases when:

- Data is sparse  
- Process signals conflict  
- Measurements are noisy  
- Operating outside trained region  

Uncertainty is **information**, not error.

---

## 4. Uncertainty as an Engineering Tool

### Why uncertainty matters

Examples:

- “Probability grain size > threshold?”  
- “Risk of porosity >1%?”  
- “Confidence in density prediction?”  

Uncertainty quantifies **risk** and **confidence**.

---

## Types of Uncertainty

### Aleatoric  
Irreducible randomness:

- Powder variability  
- Furnace drift  
- Operator variability  

### Epistemic  
Uncertainty from lack of knowledge:

- Sparse data  
- Poorly covered parameter ranges  

GPs express both.

---

## Using Uncertainty for Experiment Design

Approaches:

- Active learning  
- Uncertainty sampling  
- Bayesian optimization  

Ideas:

- Explore parameter regions with high uncertainty  
- Avoid regions with high risk  
- Improve model only where needed  

---

## Uncertainty-Aware Decision Making

Examples:

- Choose parameters where 95% of predicted grain sizes are acceptable  
- Avoid AM windows with high epistemic uncertainty  
- Optimize hardness subject to confidence constraints  
- Use uncertainty to prioritize next experiment  

Connects directly to Materials Genomics (surrogate modeling + BO).

## 5. Practical GP Pipeline

### Typical steps:

1. Collect process logs (temp/time, SPS logs, AM melt pool metrics)  
2. Derive descriptors (cooling rate, melt pool width jitter…)  
3. Fit GP on process → structure  
4. Visualize mean + uncertainty  
5. Use uncertainty to propose new experiments  
6. Validate on withheld process runs

## Example (Conceptual)

**PYTHONHERE**

(Example pipeline predicting grain size with GP and visualizing uncertainty.)

---

## 6. Summary

### Key insights:

- Process → structure mapping is noisy and nonlinear  
- Regression models give predictions; GPs give **distributions**  
- GPs excel with small experimental datasets  
- Kernel choice embeds physics  
- Uncertainty is a **design tool** for experiment planning  
- Links strongly with Materials Genomics concepts (Week 8–10 there)
