## Welcome

### Week 9 — Inverse Problems in Processing

**Goals for today:**

- Understand forward vs inverse problems  
- Learn ML-guided process maps (AM + metallurgy)  
- See why naïve regression fails  
- Explore physics-informed ML  
- Learn practical workflows for inverse process design  

---

## Outline

1. What is an inverse problem?  
2. ML-guided process maps  
3. Naïve regression pitfalls  
4. Physics-informed ML  
5. Practical workflows  
6. Summary

## 1. What Is an Inverse Problem?

Forward problem (last week):  
**process → structure**

Inverse problem:  
**desired structure → feasible process**

Examples:  

- Grain size target → heat-treatment recipe  
- Porosity target in AM → power/speed window  
- Bainite target → cooling curve  
- Densification target → SPS T–P–t profile  

Inverse problems are:

- Ill-posed  
- Non-unique  
- Noisy  
- Physics-constrained  

ML alone is not enough.

---

## Structure Is Not Deterministic

Same processing ≠ same structure:

- Variability in powder, temperature, atmosphere  
- Machine drift  
- Operator influence  
- Stochastic nucleation  

Need **probabilistic models** + **physics constraints**.

---

## 2. ML-Guided Process Maps

Process maps express:

- Operating window  
- Regime boundaries  
- Regions of defects  
- Stability and feasibility  

ML helps approximate these maps from sparse data.

---

## AM Example: Laser Power vs Scan Speed

Map axes:

- X: scan speed  
- Y: laser power  

Regions:

- Keyholing  
- Balling  
- Lack-of-fusion  
- Stable melt pool  

ML can learn:

- Regime boundaries  
- Probability of defect formation  
- Optimal window with uncertainty  

---

## Metallurgical Analogy: TTT / CCT Diagrams

TTT/CCT link:

- Temperature  
- Time / cooling rate  
- Phase fractions  

ML can:

- Interpolate sparse TTT data  
- Estimate CCT boundaries  
- Predict transformations for new alloys  
- Extend diagrams beyond available experiments  

Process maps in metallurgy ↔ process maps in AM.

---

## Other Domains: SPS and Hot Rolling

SPS:

- Temperature vs pressure vs time  
- Densification windows  

Rolling:

- T vs strain-rate vs strain  
- Grain refinement map  

All share the map-based inverse perspective.

---

## 3. Why Naïve Regression Fails

### Non-uniqueness  

Many process conditions → same structure.  
Regression returns arbitrary choices.

### Extrapolation danger  

ML smooths sharp regime boundaries → unphysical predictions.

### Sparse & biased data  

Measurements cluster in safe regions.  
ML inherits these biases.

### No physics  
Naïve ML may propose:

- Impossible cooling rates  
- Unusable laser powers  
- Negative porosity  
- Invalid phase fractions  

We need physics-informed ML.

---

## 4. Physics-Informed ML

### Physics-informed ML integrates:

- Thermodynamics  
- Kinetics  
- Diffusion constraints  
- Energy balance  
- Known boundaries  
- Domain knowledge  

This turns the inverse problem into a *constrained* exploration.

---

## Physics-Informed Methods

### Physics-informed losses  

Penalize violation of physical laws.

### Physics-informed kernels  

GP kernels encode diffusion, periodicity, smoothness.

### Hard physical constraints  

Limit search to feasible operating conditions.

### Hybrid models  
ML + simulation:  

- ML learns corrections  
- ML accelerates slow solvers  
- ML models residuals of physics equations  

---

## Examples

### AM melt pool  
Energy balance constraints  
→ ML predicts feasible laser/speed regions only.

### Heat treatment  
Transformation kinetics (Avrami)  
→ ML refines but cannot violate phase evolution rules.

### SPS  
Densification must be monotonic  
→ ML constrained in output space.

### TTT/CCT  
Phase evolution cannot reverse  
→ ML restricted by monotonicity.

---

## Physics-Informed Inverse Search

Workflow:

1. ML approximates process → structure  
2. Physics provides feasibility constraints  
3. Search only feasible region  
4. Return physically plausible process parameters  

This avoids unphysical inverse solutions.

---

## 5. Practical Workflows

### Multi-objective inverse optimization

Example: AM must balance:

- Porosity  
- Melt pool stability  
- Build rate  
- Energy efficiency  

ML finds candidate zones → physics filters them.

---

### Gaussian Process–Based Inverse Modeling

GP gives:

- Mean  
- Uncertainty  
- Smooth function behavior  
- Acquisition functions for exploration

Use GP to:

- Explore uncertain regions  
- Identify optimum with confidence bounds  
- Run Bayesian optimization for process tuning

### Student Mindset

“When designing a process, ML does not give **one answer** — it gives **a distribution**, **feasible regions**, and **confidence**.”

---

## 6. Summary

### Key insights:

- Inverse problems ask: “Which processing route yields the target structure?”  
- ML-guided process maps unify AM and metallurgy  
- Naïve regression is unsafe for inverse tasks  
- Physics-informed ML respects constraints and kinetics  
- Hybrid ML–physics approaches are the future of process design  
- Inverse maps + uncertainty = actionable materials engineering
