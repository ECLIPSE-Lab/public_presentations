In structural biology, three-dimensional structures of proteins are routinely determined from thousands of identical particles using phase-contrast TEM. In materials science, three-dimensional atomic structures of complex nanomaterials have been determined using atomic electron tomography (AET). However, neither of these methods can determine the three-dimensional atomic structure of heterogeneous nanomaterials containing light elements. Here, we perform ptychographic electron tomography from 34.5 million diffraction patterns to reconstruct an atomic resolution tilt series of a double wall-carbon nanotube (DW-CNT) encapsulating a complex ZrTe sandwich structure. Class averaging the resulting tilt series images and subpixel localization of the atomic peaks reveals a Zr11Te50 structure containing a previously unobserved ZrTe2 phase in the core.

While it was developed principally for high-resolution studies in materials science, the possibility to collect the entire transmitted flux makes it attractive for cryomicroscopy in application to life science and radiation-sensitive materials where dose efficiency is of utmost importance.

Full integration with the SerialEM platform conveniently provides all the tools for grid navigation and automation of the data collection. Scripts are provided to convert the raw data to mrc format files and further to generate a variety of modes representing both scattering and phase contrasts, including incoherent and annular bright field, integrated center of mass, and parallax decomposition of a simulated integrated differential phase contrast. Principal component analysis of virtual annular detectors proves particularly useful, and axial contrast is improved by 3D deconvolution with an optimized point spread function.

  abstractNote={Helical structures are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic materials across multiple length scales. Excellent and sometimes unusual chiral optical, mechanical, and sensing properties have been previously demonstrated in such symmetry-breaking shape, yet a general principle to realize helical structures at the sub-100 nm scale via colloidal synthesis remains underexplored. In this work, we describe the wet-chemical synthesis of monodisperse nanohelices based on gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3). Aberration-corrected electron microscopy revealed that individual nanohelices consist of a bilayer structure with the outer and inner layers derived from the {111} and {100} planes of bulk Gd2O3, respectively. Distinct from existing inorganic nanocoils with flexible bending geometries, the built-in lattice misfit between two adjacent crystal planes induces continuous helical growth yielding three-dimensional rigid nanohelices. Furthermore, the presence of water in the reaction was found to suppress the formation of nanohelices, producing nanoplates expressing predominantly {111} planes. Our study not only provides a bottom-up synthetic route and mechanistic understanding of nanohelices formation but may also open up new possibilities for creating chiral plasmonic nanostructures, luminescent biological labels, and nanoscale transducers.}, number={29}, journal={Journal of the American Chemical Society}, publisher={American Chemical Society}, author={Liu, Yang and Li, Yuda and Jeong, Soojin and Wang, Yi and Chen, Jun and Ye, Xingchen}, year={2020}, month=jul, pages={12777–12783} }

In the last 20 years the basic ideas of X-ray diffraction analysis have been extended to the field of electron microscopy, whereby an image-forming apparatus is converted into an electron diffractometer, and through which an old dream of crystallographers can be realized—the measurement of the phase shift of scattered waves, a prerequisite for the direct calculation of structures. Its most important area of application, like that of the X-ray diffractometer, is in three-dimensional structure analysis—in all fields of science. However, beyond crystallography, aperiodic structures (comparable to crystals with a single unit cell) can also be analyzed three-dimensionally. In this progress report, the development of the first idea (spatial frequency filtering) to the analysis of ribosomal particles is outlined. Attention will be focused primarily on quantitative methods for the measurement of scattered rays, which are also usable beyond the conventional limit of resolution, down to atomic resolution. In the course of this work in 1968, the principle of the three-dimensional analysis of native biological crystal structures using the electron microscope, as worked with today in many laboratories, was developed. In Munich, however, further research focused on the three-dimensional analysis of aperiodic and individual (especially biological) objects. The analysis of 50S-subunits of the procaryotic ribosome of E. coli showed surprisingly good reproducibility of the results (although only within the same orientation), allowing the deduction of almost ideal average model structures from a limited number of particles.}, number={6}, journal={Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English}, author={Hoppe, Walter}, year={1983}, pages={456–485}, language={en} }

We develop two physically informed metrics, areal oversampling and Ronchigram magnification, to describe the selection of these parameters in multislice ptychography. Through simulations, we comprehensively evaluate the validity of these two metrics over a broad range of conditions and show that they accurately guide reconstruction success. Further, we validate these conclusions with experimental ptychographic data and demonstrate close agreement between trends in simulated and experimental data. Using these metrics, we achieve experimental multislice reconstructions at a scan step of 2.1Å/px, enabling large field-of-view, data-efficient reconstructions.

As reflected in its name, coherent diffractive imaging relies on high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved images from diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming lenses. Fully coherent light can be described adequately by a single pure state. Yet partial coherence and imperfect detection often need to be accounted for, requiring statistical optics or the superposition of states. Furthermore, the dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of experiments. Here we provide a general analytic approach to the characterization of diffractive imaging systems that can be described as low-rank mixed states. We use experimental data and simulations to show how the reconstruction technique compensates for and characterizes various sources of decoherence quantitatively. Based on ptychography, the procedure is closely related to quantum state tomography and is equally applicable to high-resolution microscopy, wave sensing and fluctuation measurements. As a result, some of the most stringent experimental conditions in ptychography can be relaxed, and susceptibility to imaging artefacts is reduced. Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution images of mixed states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations, switching or steady flows.}, note={Citation Key: Thibault2013b

In this work we introduce a new phase contrast imaging method in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) using a pre-specimen phase plate in the probe forming aperture, combined with a fast pixelated detector to record diffraction patterns at every probe position, and phase reconstruction using ptychography. The phase plate significantly enhances the contrast transfer of low spatial frequency information, and ptychography maximizes the extraction of the phase information at all spatial frequencies. In addition, the STEM probe with the presence of the phase plate retains its atomic resolution, allowing simultaneous incoherent Z-contrast imaging to be obtained along with the ptychographic phase image.
