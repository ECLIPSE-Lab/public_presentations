## Welcome

### Week 1 — What is Materials Genomics?

**Goals for today:**

- Understand why a “genomics” framing is used in materials science  
- Learn the analogy: genes ↔ atoms, genotype ↔ structure, phenotype ↔ properties  
- See the historical development of key materials databases  
- Connect Materials Genomics to the PSPP framework (from the structure-first viewpoint)  

---

## Outline

1. Why a “genomics” framework?  
2. Genomics analogy for materials  
3. Key databases and their impact  
4. PSPP from a structure-first perspective  
5. Example genomics workflows  
6. Wrap-up & discussion  

---

## 1. Why Materials Genomics?

Materials science faces:

- A combinatorial explosion of possible compounds (~10⁵⁰+)  
- Complex, high-dimensional structure–property relationships  
- Slow, expensive traditional experimentation  
- Increasing demand for rapid materials discovery  

Modern solutions:

- High-throughput computation  
- Large curated databases  
- ML models that map structure → properties  
- Automated workflows for screening and design  

Materials Genomics provides the **systematic, data-centered approach** to explore this enormous materials space.

---

## The Big Idea

Just as biology shifted from:

- Single-gene experiments → entire genome sequencing  
- 
materials science moves from:

- Single-material intuition → high-throughput exploration of materials space.

Materials Genomics =  
**encode structures digitally → compute properties → build predictive models → guide discovery.**

---

## 2. The Genomics Analogy

### Biological genomics
- Genome = ordered sequence of nucleotides  
- Genotype → phenotype  
- Mutations change function  
- High-throughput sequencing enables search across massive spaces  

### Materials genomics
- “Genome” = atomic arrangement + chemical species  
- “Genotype” = crystal structure, symmetry, coordination  
- “Phenotype” = properties (band gap, strength, conductivity)  
- “Mutations” = alloying, doping, distortions, substitutions  
- “Sequencing” = high-throughput DFT or automated experiments  

---

## Key Insight

**Structure encodes function.**  
Atoms + positions = information code  
Properties = emergent behavior  
Tasks:

- Decode structure → property  
- Search structure space for desired property  
- Predict which new structures will perform well  

This analogy frames the rest of the course.

---

## 3. Historical Development of Materials Databases

Materials Genomics depends on large, curated databases.

### AFLOW
- Among the first automated high-throughput DFT frameworks  
- Standardized workflows (elastic tensors, charges, hull stability)  
- Enabled combinatorial exploration of structure + chemistry  

---

### OQMD
- Massive DFT dataset (over 1 million structures)  
- Focused on formation energies and stability  
- Enabled systematic phase diagram construction  
- Essential for alloy and multi-component systems  

---

### Materials Project
- Brought high-throughput DFT to the public  
- Easy search interfaces + API access  
- Elastic tensors, band structures, phase diagrams, dielectric constants  
- A major teaching and prototyping resource  

---

### NOMAD
- FAIR repository for raw computational output  
- Emphasis on interoperability across codes  
- European ecosystem for reproducible materials data  
- Enables large-scale ML by unifying formats and metadata  

---

## Why These Databases Matter

They provide:
- Large training sets  
- Standardization & reproducibility  
- Public benchmarks  
- Shared infrastructure for ML research  
- A common language for the community  

Without them, Materials Genomics would not exist as a field.

---

## 4. PSPP From a Structure-First Perspective

Processing → Structure → Properties → Performance  
(Your ML course focused on *processing-first*.)

Materials Genomics works backwards:

1. **Desired performance**  
   e.g., optical transparency, catalytic activity, conductivity  

2. **Required properties**  
   band gap, adsorption energies, activation barriers  

3. **Candidate structures**  
   perovskites, Heuslers, spinels, MXenes, zeolites  

4. **Processing routes**  
   how to synthesize them in reality  

---

## Structure as the Information Layer

Central idea:
**Structure determines properties more directly than processing.**

Thus Materials Genomics focuses heavily on:
- Representation of structure  
- Descriptors/featurization  
- Predictive models  
- Screening across structural families  

---

## 5. Example Genomics Workflows

### Example 1 — Band Gap Prediction
1. Encode structure  
2. Extract features  
3. Train ML model  
4. Predict band gaps for thousands of candidates  
5. Select promising materials for synthesis  

---

### Example 2 — Phase Stability Screening
1. High-throughput DFT: formation energies  
2. Construct convex hull  
3. Identify stable and near-stable materials  
4. Propose synthesis targets  

---

### Example 3 — Fast-Ion Conductors
1. Analyze local coordination networks  
2. Estimate migration pathways  
3. Predict ionic conductivity via ML  
4. Explore chemical substitutions  

---

### Example 4 — Catalysis Discovery
1. Compute adsorption energies for surface sites  
2. Use ML to map composition → adsorption  
3. Construct volcano plots  
4. Identify optimal catalytic compositions  

---

## What These Examples Teach

- Genomics is *systematic*, not anecdotal  
- It works because structure can be encoded digitally  
- ML accelerates screening  
- Computation guides experiment  
- High-throughput workflows replace trial-and-error  

---

## 6. Wrap-Up

### Key insights from today:
- Materials Genomics = data-rich, structure-centered discovery  
- The genomics analogy frames structure–property reasoning  
- AFLOW, OQMD, Materials Project, NOMAD built the modern ecosystem  
- PSPP can be inverted: performance → properties → structure  
- Sets the stage for Weeks 2–14: descriptors, ML models, surrogate design, and autonomous discovery  

---

## Discussion

Questions to consider:
- Where does the genomics analogy break down?  
- What limits high-throughput computation today?  
- How might autonomous labs close the loop between prediction and experiment?
