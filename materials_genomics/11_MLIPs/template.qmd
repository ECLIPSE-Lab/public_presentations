## Welcome

### Week 2 — Crystal Structure Fundamentals

**Goals:**

- Understand symmetry in crystals  
- Learn space groups & Wyckoff positions  
- See how symmetry reduces structural complexity  
- Understand why symmetry matters for ML descriptors  
- Use pymatgen / spglib to analyze symmetry (conceptually)  

---

## Outline

1. Why symmetry matters  
2. Lattices & crystal systems  
3. Space groups & symmetry operations  
4. Wyckoff positions  
5. How symmetry informs descriptors  
6. Hands-on exercise  

---

## 1. Why Symmetry Matters in Materials Genomics

Crystal structure encodes:

- Atomic arrangement  
- Local coordination  
- Bond topology  
- Allowed physical behaviors  

Symmetry:

- Compresses the description of an infinite periodic structure  
- Governs degeneracy of properties  
- Influences electronic/phonon behavior  
- Shapes which descriptors are meaningful  

---

## Structure as Information

In Materials Genomics:

- Structure = “genotype”  
- Properties = “phenotype”  
- Symmetry = the coordinate system of the genotype  

Symmetry is essential for:

- Standardization  
- Featurization  
- Machine learning invariance  
- Pattern recognition  

---

## 2. Lattices, Bravais Types, Crystal Systems

### Review

- Lattice vectors \(a, b, c\)  
- Angles \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\)  
- Fractional vs Cartesian coordinates  

### 7 Crystal Systems

- Triclinic  
- Monoclinic  
- Orthorhombic  
- Tetragonal  
- Trigonal  
- Hexagonal  
- Cubic  

### 14 Bravais Lattices

Students should understand:
- The Bravais lattice = translational skeleton  
- The unit cell is not unique  
- The *primitive* cell is the minimal representation  

---

## Why This Matters

For ML pipelines:

- Structures must often be standardized  
- spglib reduces to conventional and primitive forms  
- Descriptors assume stable ordering of atoms  

---

## 3. Space Groups & Symmetry Operations

### Space Groups

- Combine translations + point-group operations  
- 230 distinct groups  
- Govern all symmetry-allowed operations  

### Symmetry Operations

- Rotations  
- Reflections  
- Inversions  
- Improper rotations  
- Glide planes  
- Screw axes  

---

## Understanding Space Groups

Examples:

- Rocksalt (Fm-3m) → high symmetry  
- Perovskites (Pm-3m, Pnma…) → symmetry-lowering distortions  
- Wurtzite (P6₃mc) → polar axis  

Students should learn to:

- Interpret space group symbols  
- See symmetry in atomic environments  

---

## Symmetry Reduces Independent Information

Example:

- High-symmetry structures have fewer unique sites  
- Low-symmetry structures have many inequivalent positions  

Symmetry determines:

- Elastic tensor components  
- Optical activity  
- Electronic degeneracies  
- Phonon selection rules  

---

## 4. Wyckoff Positions

Wyckoff positions describe:

- Equivalent atomic sites  
- Multiplicity = number of equivalent atoms  
- Site symmetry = allowed operations at that point  

Each space group has Wyckoff labels: a, b, c, …

---

## Why Wyckoff Positions Matter

They define:

- Prototype structures  
- Where atoms “live” in a symmetry-consistent way  
- Which substitution or vacancy sites are distinct  
- How many unique environments must be featurized  

Example: Perovskite ABO₃  
- A on 1a  
- B on 1b  
- O on 3c  

---

## Wyckoff Patterns as Structural Fingerprints

- Ideal perovskite vs distorted perovskite  
- Spinels, Heuslers, antifluorites  
- Site splitting reveals structural transitions  

These patterns are building blocks for genomic classification.

---

## 5. How Symmetry Informs Descriptors

ML descriptors must be:

- Invariant to rotation  
- Invariant to translation  
- Invariant to permutation of equivalent atoms  

Symmetry gives the rules for these invariances.

---

## Examples of Symmetry-Aware Descriptors

### Coordination-based features
- Coordination numbers  
- Radial distribution histogram  
- Bond-angle distributions  

### Local environment descriptors
- Voronoi features  
- Atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSF)  
- SOAP (spherical harmonics representation)  

### Graph-based descriptors
- Crystal Graph Convolutional Networks  
- Message-Passing Neural Networks  
- Symmetry preserves node equivalence  

---

## Why Symmetry Makes ML Better

Symmetry:

- Reduces redundant features  
- Ensures physically meaningful predictions  
- Makes models data-efficient  
- Encodes constraints directly into representation  

---

## Designing Symmetry-Informed Features

Teach students:

- A descriptor must not change if the crystal is rotated  
- Equivalent atomic sites have identical descriptors  
- Operations must respect periodicity  

This understanding becomes essential in Weeks 3–4.

---

## 6. Hands-On Exercise: pymatgen + spglib

Goal:

- Analyze symmetry from structure files  
- Identify space group and Wyckoff positions  
- Standardize cells  
- Extract symmetry operations  

---

## Demonstrated Workflow (Conceptual)

Example code placeholder:

**PYTHONHERE**

Operations to illustrate:

- `SpacegroupAnalyzer(struct)`  
- `get_space_group_symbol()`  
- `get_conventional_standard_structure()`  
- `get_primitive_standard_structure()`  
- `get_symmetry_operations()`  
- `get_wyckoff_symbols()`  

---

## Suggested Demo Structures

- NaCl (Fm-3m) — simple cubic symmetry  
- CaTiO₃ — ideal vs distorted perovskite  
- Diamond — covalent network symmetry  
- β-Ga₂O₃ — low symmetry example  

Students see:

- How symmetry interprets structure  
- Why standardization is essential  
- How ML descriptors depend on symmetry  

---

## Summary

- Why symmetry is central to Materials Genomics  
- Space groups, Wyckoff positions, symmetry operations  
- How symmetry reduces complexity  
- How symmetry shapes descriptors  
- How pymatgen/spglib automate symmetry analysis
